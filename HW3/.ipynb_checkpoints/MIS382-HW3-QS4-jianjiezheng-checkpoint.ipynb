    "Adagrad (http://ruder.io/optimizing-gradient-descent/) differs from vanilla SGD in that the learning rate of each weight changes over updates. A cache is maintained that holds the sum of squares of all gradients upto the current update. The learning_rate is divided by the cache, resulting in a different learning rate for each weight. A consequence of this update rule is that weights that have already seen large gradients (made large jumps) make smaller updates in subsequent iterations.\n",

    "I think class-conditional likelihood of a class given an input is probability of a feature such as X_1 given that this feature belongs to a specific class C1, mathematically denoted by $p(x_1|C1)$. In addition, class prior in this case refers to $P(C1)$, which means the probability of getting class C1 when we are given a data point. Then, posterior probability stands for $P(C1|X_1)$, which means probability of it belongs to class C1 given it has feature X_1. The relationship between these three can be expressed by $P(C1|X_1) = \\cfrac{P(X_1|C1)*P(C_1)}{P(X_1)}$. So, if we keep class prior constant, as class-conditional likelihood of a given class increases, the posterior probability also increases and they are positively related to each other. On the other hand, if we keep the class-conditional likelihood constant, as class prior increases, the posterior probability decreases and they are negatively related to each other."

Since we are given class conditional distribution $p([x_1,x_2]|C)$ is Gaussian, so each feature has same variance and are independent from each other. Therefore, we have $g_1(x) = \\cfrac{||x- \\mu_1||^2}{2\\sigma^2} + lnP(w_1)$ and $g_2(x) = \\cfrac{||x- \\mu_2||^2}{2\\sigma^2} + lnP(w_2)$.

    "# Question 5: Decision Tree using Python (10 pts)\n",
    "In this problem, you will model the data using decision trees to perform a classification task. Load the BreastTissue.csv dataset. The dataset has been preprocessed. The description of the dataset can be found [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Tissue). Using the class tree.DecisionTreeClassifier (http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html#module-sklearn.tree), build two different trees with a maximum depth of two using the split criteria (i) Gini and (ii) Entropy. Use all the data to build trees. Plot the two trees. If your classifier object is called clf, use the following commands to save the generated tree as a '.dot' file that can be used to visualize the tree using Webgraphviz: http://www.webgraphviz.com/\n",
